# G27_ESP32_BLE_Joystick

!!! I'm not a programmer and this is just my personal code shared with you, so don't expect a clean or ressource saving code :)

I love my G27-Racing-Wheel and needed more buttons, so I've extended it with two rotary buttons.

For my Project I'm using two ky-040 Rotary Encoders as inputs, a ESP32 and a 3D-Printed Plate for the G27.
